# Cypress Project

## Introduction
* In this project I created 3 test scenarios for testing the sause lab demo web site.

* Used the Page Object Model design pattern. So every pages have own page classes and we can find the page methods in that classes.

* Created a custom command for picking the random items from the items list. You can find it in cypress/support/commands.js

* With "Add To Card An Item And Checkout Successfully" test scenario we are testing end-to-end main features of the website. Steps are;

  * Login with the standart user,
  * Picking one of random item from list,
  * Opening the detail page and verifying the item name,
  * Adding to card and verifying the shopping card badge number,
  * Going to shopping card page and verifying the prices are exactly same with detail page.
  * Continue to the information page and filling the first, last name and zip code areas.
  * Then after that page we are gonna confirm the prices also same with the confirming page.
  * And the final page confirming the checkout is success.

* With "Try to login with locked user" and "Try to login with wrong username and password" text scenarios we are achiving;

  * When the user try to login with the locked user or wrong username and password, they will see the error message on the screen and the login is not success.
